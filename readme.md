##Balanced Ternary Search Tree is implemented with following conditions:
1. Left child should be smaller than right child
2. Left / Right child should contain only integer
3. Middle child should contain a sorted list of floats greater than left child and less than right child
4. Implement push , remove and print for any given level operations
5. It should read inputs from a text file, values separated by a newline

Methods in balacedTernarySearchTree class:<br/>
a)push(data) <br/>
push element in tree if it is float in appropriate middleList else new node attached as child.
b)search(search_value)<br/>
find search value
c)remove(remove_value)<br/>
remove remove_value
d)print()<br/>
prints tree in Left - MiddleList - Nodedata - Right of every node basically depth first traversal
e)printLevelOrder()<br/>
prints level order traversal of tree<br/>

<br/>
Implemented method to read input from files line by line in driver.py.<br/>
Required format of input text file is as given in input.txt.<br/>
Console based interaction in driverConsole.py
